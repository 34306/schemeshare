a PoC that maybe an exploit that can read and export all system file from iOS 16.0 to 18.2 beta 1. Got patched on iOS 18.2 beta 2

# Story
I'm just accidently found it when I tried Duy's method about symlink, since it cannot shared over the Airdrop or file saved (only via email). Then I copied it by symlink the file to Files (default app by Apple) on my 15 Pro (iOS 17.0, TrollStore, accessed by Filza) and accidently found it.
